# Band

McNairy Cenral Highschool 

Declan Price (sophmore)
I found the client (MCHS Band) and was the communicator between the group and the Band Director Mr. Foret. In code I worked on mainly HTML and came up with what pages should be included. I also found all the information and images that are in the website. I thought up how each page should be structured and looked. I could not have done this website without Daniel. 

Daniel Porter (senior)
I worked on the CSS portion of the code and edited HTML when needed. I positioned all of the elements as well as designed and created the footer. I polished up the HTML when we were getting ready to publish the site. I could not have stayed organized without Declan.
